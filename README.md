## Key Features

-   **Scientific & Standard Operations:** Performs basic arithmetic as well as scientific functions like square root, powers, percentages, and pi.
-   **Accurate Calculations:** Uses the `math.js` library to correctly handle the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS) for complex expressions.
-   **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, iPhone-inspired design with a dynamic, animated gradient background and a digital-style display font.
-   **Responsive Design:** The interface is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles invalid inputs and mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero) by displaying an "Error" message.

## Technology Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the calculator.
-   **CSS3:** For the custom styling, grid layout, and the animated background.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ESM):** For all core functionality, including event handling and DOM manipulation.
-   **Math.js Library:** Integrated to provide a robust and safe engine for evaluating mathematical expressions.
